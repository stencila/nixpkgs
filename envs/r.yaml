name: r
description: >
  An environment containing R, the programming language and free software
  environment for statistical computing and graphics.
comments: >
  This environment includes `coreutils` because when running R in a pure 
  environment without that package you get errors about `uname` and `rm` missing
  (and possibly others?)
adds:
  - r
  - coreutils
