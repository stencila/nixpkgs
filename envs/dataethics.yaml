description: >
  An environment for the Data Ethics course run at the University of Canterbury in March-June 2019. The course is run
  using Stencila Hub and requires R and Python to be available with a few specific packages.
comments: >
  This environment includes `coreutils` because when running R in a pure 
  environment without that package you get errors about `uname` and `rm` missing
  (and possibly others?). It includes packages specifically required for the Data Ethics course, such as,
  `neuralnet`, `tree`, `randomForest`, `tidyverse`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `numpy`. 
  The package `MASS` is added for the same reasons as `coreutils`.
